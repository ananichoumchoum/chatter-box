### Project Overview

This project is currently in progress and is in its first phase. Future phases will incorporate machine learning, camera, and text-to-speech technologies. Please use this project responsibly and ethically, as it is designed to assist with pattern recognition and educational purposes only. Misuse could jeopardize its availability or usage.

I am intentionally providing limited details about the project to encourage independent exploration and understanding. However, I am open to collaboration, so feel free to contact me if you are interested in working together.
